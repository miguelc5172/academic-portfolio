# HW5: Graph Analysis Assignment (C)

This project contains two C-based tools for analyzing and working with graphs:

## 📁 `course_graph/`
A course prerequisite analyzer that builds a directed graph from an input file and checks for cycles. This helps determine whether the course structure is valid (e.g., no circular prerequisites).

## 📁 `interactive_graph/`
An interactive command-line graph tool allowing the user to manually create a graph, insert edges, print structure, and possibly test reachability or connectivity. Useful for visualizing and experimenting with graph concepts.

Each folder contains its own README and usage instructions.
