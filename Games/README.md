# Games

All of my developed games are published on my [Itch.io](https://lonesloth205.itch.io/) page under the name, LoneSloth.

Here is a list of my current published games as well as a description of them:

## Hysteria
A Binding of Isaac–style dungeon crawler with enemy spawning, projectile combat, RNG item drops, particle effects, and a full game loop (main menu, gameplay, death screen). You play as the silent protagonist trapped inside a nightmare realm known as Limbo. Your only goal: find a way to escape without turning into a shadow. You do so by descending deeper into Limbo. There are currently only two levels. There was a third level planned with a boss fight but due to time constraints I wasn't able to implement it. There are three items pickups available.

## P.E.M.D.A.S.: Training Day
P.E.M.D.A.S.: Training Day is an educational game that teachers players how to use order of operations to solve math problems. You play as a new recruit for the Problem Eradicating Math Defense Assault Squad (PEMDAS) tasked with eradicating the world of monsters through the power of math. This game focuses on your first day in which you undergo a training simulation utilizing the Advanced Mathematical Combat System (AMCS) which helps target enemy weakpoints as well as defend from enemy attacks.
