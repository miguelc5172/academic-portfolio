# Academic Portfolio  

This repository serves as a central hub for my coursework, projects, and assignments completed during my Computer Science degree. It showcases my progress across a variety of classes — from systems programming and data structures to secure programming and full-stack development.  

Each folder highlights a different course or project with dedicated documentation to explain context, objectives, and outcomes.  

🔹 The portfolio is actively being updated at intervals as I continue to refine past work and add new projects.  
🔹 My goal is to provide a clear view of both my technical growth and my ability to organize, document, and present my work.  

Feel free to explore the repository structure to see how my skills have developed across multiple domains of computer science and to reach out about any questions regarding my experience.
